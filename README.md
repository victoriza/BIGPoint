The goal is to implement the interface of a gas station which has multiple gas pumps. Each
gas pump provides a specific amount of gas of a certain gas type.
Additionally, customers are requesting gas with different requirements regarding the
amount, type of gas and price they are willing to pay for it. Your implementation has to
take all this into account and serve gas when available. For further information please refer to the documentation of our classes. 

The zip-file attached to the mail contains a maven-module which you can import into your IDE (tested with Eclipse). Please create your own module and add our module as dependency. It would be best to upload your work to GitHub frequently and give us access to it afterwards. In case of
any problems you can attach your solution to an email as well.
